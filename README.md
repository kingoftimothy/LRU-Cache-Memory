# LRU Cache Memory Performance Enhancement Project

Developed a cache memory simulator in C, enhancing the understanding of cache operation and its impact on C program performance. Implemented a modular solution utilizing C structs, malloc/free, and C file I/O. Utilized gdb, valgrind, and ASan for debugging and memory leak detection. Optimal design choices achieved through understanding of cache behavior and applying the LRU replacement policy. Extra credit: Explored cache optimization techniques for matrix transposition.
